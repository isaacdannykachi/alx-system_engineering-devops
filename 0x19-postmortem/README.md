Postmortem: E-commerce Checkout Error

---

**Issue Summary:**
- **Duration**: From 2:00 PM to 4:45 PM GMT, March 10, 2024, our payment API decided to take an unexpected siesta.
- **Impact**: Around 65% of our users experienced a new "feature" - the vanishing transactions trick. Presto! No money for you... or us.
- **Root Cause**: A sneaky memory leak in the payment module, probably plotting its escape since the last code deployment.

**Timeline:**
- **2:05 PM**: Monitoring system throws a tantrum with error rates off the charts.
- **2:10 PM**: An eagle-eyed engineer spots the payment service playing dead.
- **2:15 PM**: Team dives into recent deployments, rummaging through logs like digital dumpster divers.
- **3:00 PM**: We chase a red herring, suspecting a database deadlock was the party pooper.
- **3:30 PM**: Incident gets escalated faster than an executive in an elevator, right to the senior backend team.
- **4:30 PM**: Eureka! The memory leak is caught red-handed.
- **4:45 PM**: A hotfix is whipped up faster than a barista's espresso, and voil√†, service is back.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
- **Cause**: A new feature was more gluttonous with memory than a browser with tabs.
- **Resolution**: Rolled back the update and patched the code faster than a pirate with a leaky ship.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**
- **Improvements**: We're sprucing up our code review process and putting our monitoring system on high alert.
- **Tasks**:
  - Update the deployment checklist with a "no memory leaks allowed" policy.
  - Automate a "take two steps back" feature for deployments gone rogue.
  - Patch the payment module to be as memory-efficient as a minimalist's backpack.
  - Set up an early warning system for memory usage shenanigans.
